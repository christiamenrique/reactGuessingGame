# reactGuessingGame

* I created a guessing game app using React.
* When the page loads, it displays a header that says Start Game and underneath it has two buttons. One button read Standard and the other read Expert. If the user clicks Standard, it randomly generates a number between 1 and 10 for the user to guess. * The expert is between 1 and 100. Once either of these buttons is clicked, the game starts.
* There is an input for the user to guess a number and submit.
* There is a place that shows how many guesses they have made.
* Once the user guesses, it will tell them whether their guess was too high or too low.
* Once the user wins, it displays a message telling them that they have won and how many guesses it took.
* It keeps track of the least number of tries it takes the user to win. This is the "High Score".
* It keeps separate track of the high score for the standard and expert levels.

### Install

* git clone https://github.com/christiamenrique/reactGuessingGame.git.
